> This demonstration highlights the power of Cypress in performing end-to-end (E2E) and component testing within an application. It showcases how Cypress helps ensure that all features and components are functioning as expected by simulating user interactions, verifying workflows, and identifying issues early in the development process. This testing approach guarantees the reliability and quality of the application’s functionality.

# Open a new terminal window/tab and run the following command for component and E2E tests:
npm run test

# Open another new terminal window/tab and run this command to launch Cypress in GUI mode for interactive testing:
